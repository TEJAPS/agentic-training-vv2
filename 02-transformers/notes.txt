GPT - generative pretrained transformer

Generative - bots that generate new text

pre trained - shows how model went through process of learning for massive data,  
and the prefix insinuates that there's more room to fine tune it to on specific tasks with additional training.

transformer - specific kind of neural network, a ML model, core invention underlying AI.

With transformer we can build various models -
    voice to text 
    text to voice
    text to image - DALLE , midjourney

2017 - Attention is all you need - language translation by google

Transformer(GPT2 / GPT3) - whole purpose is to predict the next word based on probability distribution of the context.
    repeat the same step, and generate full para, books, etc.
    this probability and prediction is in short what transformer does.

    then it goes through Multi layer perceptron or feed forward layer - goes through similar math operation instead of talking to each other.
        like: ask questions and updates each col individually
        ex: normalization
    
    many repetitions of attention and MLP
    and last layer goes through probability distribution to predict next token.

System prompt
GPT2 GPT3 and so on....

GPT3 - 175 billion parameters with 27,938 matrics
    has vocab of 50k words/tokens
    and has embedding matrix - where every word will have 1 column = We
        it gets modified based on data
    embedding space = 12,288 coordinates
    Embedding matrix = 12288 * 50257 = 617,558,016 weights





Tokenization - input is broken into small tokens. 
    token is mapped with vector
    vector goes through some operations called attention block to update its values
    ex: model meaning in diff context

Neural Networks (the foundation)
    A neural network is a bunch of layers that:
    Take numbers in
    Multiply + add weights
    Pass through activation functions
    Learn by adjusting weights using backpropagation

    Examples: 
        Feed-forward NN
        CNNs (images, videos, spatial data) - Convolutional Neural Network - looks at local pattern - learns hierarchially
        RNNs(seqential data, time series, text early NLP) - Recurrent Neural Network - Remember previous inputs
            problem: forget long term context, vanishing gradients
        LSTMs (sequences) - Long Short-Term Memory - It fixes RNN problems using gates - speech recognition, time series forecasting, language translation(pre transformer era)

    | Model       | Best for       | Core idea               | Limitation           |
    | ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
    | CNN         | Images         | Local pattern detection | Not for sequences    |
    | RNN         | Sequences      | Memory over time        | Forgets long context |
    | LSTM        | Long sequences | Gated memory            | Slow, sequential     |
    | Transformer | Text, LLMs     | Attention               | Compute heavy        |

Deep Learning (neural networks, but deep)
    Deep Learning = neural networks with many layers
    Why depth matters:
        Early layers learn simple patterns
        Deeper layers learn abstract concepts
    Used in:
        Vision
        Speech
        NLP (language)
    👉 Still neural networks — just bigger + deeper.

NLP before Transformers (why they were needed)
    Before transformers, NLP used:
    RNN / LSTM
    Problems:
        Process words one by one
        Hard to parallelize
        Forget long-range context
        Slow + unstable for long text

    Example pain:
        “The book that I bought last year from the store near my house was expensive”
        RNN struggles to connect “book” ↔ “was” across long distance.

Transformers (the breakthrough):
    Transformer = a deep neural network architecture designed for sequences (text)
    Look at all words at the same time and decide what matters

    The transformer is the block labeled “[*×N] Layers: Attention + MLP”.
    GPT is a decoder-only Transformer, meaning the model is literally a stack of Transformer blocks.

    Multi-Head Self-Attention
    → Lets each token attend to other tokens from multiple representation subspaces to capture different relationships in parallel.

    Feed-Forward Network (MLP)
    → Applies a position-wise non-linear transformation to each token independently to increase model expressiveness.

    Residual Connections
    → Add the layer’s input back to its output to preserve information and enable stable training of very deep networks.

    Layer Normalization
    → Normalizes activations across features to stabilize gradients and speed up training.

A Transformer is a neural network architecture built from repeated blocks of
self-attention + feed-forward layers, connected with residuals and normalization.

The number of transformer layers is not chosen by “accuracy intuition” — it is chosen by compute budget,
    data size, scaling laws, and training stability.
    You ask “how big can I afford to train reliably?”

🧠 Self-Attention (the magic)
    Every word looks at every other word

    Learns relationships like:
        subject ↔ verb
        pronoun ↔ noun
        cause ↔ effect

    Example:
        “I deposited money in the bank near the river”
    The word bank attends to river, not money institution.

Inside a transformer:
    Linear layers (weights)
    Matrix multiplications
    Activations
    Backpropagation
    Loss function
    👉 No new math, just a better structure.

LLMs (Transformers on steroids):
    LLM = a very large transformer trained on huge text corpora
    What makes it “large”:
        Billions / trillions of parameters
    
    Trained on:
        Books
        Code
        Articles
        Conversations

    Training objective:
        Predict the next token

    Example:
    “Transformers are very powerful because they ___”
    Model predicts: “can model long-range dependencies”

| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Neural Net    | Mathematical model with weights     |
| Deep Learning | Many-layer neural nets              |
| Transformer   | A specific deep neural net design   |
| LLM           | Massive transformer trained on text |

Transformers are not “AI brains” — they’re just very good at learning relationships between tokens using attention.

What makes transformers perfect for LLMs?
    ✅ Parallel training (fast on GPUs)
    ✅ Handles long context
    ✅ Captures grammar + semantics
    ✅ Scales insanely well
